## What is it?

**Make every Critical Hit feel legendary.**

This module adds visceral impact to your Daggerheart sessions in Foundry VTT. When a player or GM rolls a critical success, the screen reacts with immersive visual effects and sound, amplifying the tension and excitement of the moment.

## Why use this?

In a narrative game like Daggerheart, a Critical Success is a major story beat. It shouldn't just be a text notification in the chat. This module ensures that everyone at the table *feels* the impact when the dice roll high.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **💥 Visual Impact:** Choose from four distinct visual effects:
    * **Glass Shatter:** The screen cracks and shards fly—perfect for high-impact moments.
    * **Screen Shake:** A physical rumble that sells the weight of the blow.
    * **Pulsate:** A rhythmic visual heartbeat for magical or psychic intense moments.
    * **Blood/Energy Border:** A glowing border that constricts the screen (customizable color).

* **🔊 Audio Immersion:** Automatically plays sound effects (SFX) when a crit lands.
    * *Fully customizable:* Set your own sounds for Players and GMs separately.

* **⚔️ Duality vs. Adversary:**
    * **For Players (Duality Dice):** Triggers when the Hope & Fear dice match.
    * **For GMs (Adversary):** Triggers when the d20 rolls a natural 20 (or is marked as critical).
    * *Unique Settings:* You can set different effects for Players vs. GMs (e.g., Players get "Glass Shatter" with orchestral music, while GMs get a red "Screen Border" with a horror sting).

* **✨ Critical Splash:** Displays a stylish "CRITICAL" overlay with the character's name, so there is no confusion about who just did something awesome.

## 🛠️ How to Use

This module is designed to be **Plug & Play**.

1.  **Install & Enable:** Once enabled, it works immediately with default settings.
2.  **Configuration:** Go to `Module Settings` -> `Daggerheart: Critical FX`.
3.  **Customize:**
    * **Visual FX:** Open the configuration menu to pick your preferred effect (Shake, Shatter, etc.) and adjust intensity/duration.
    * **Sounds:** Upload your own `.mp3` or `.ogg` files to match your campaign's vibe.
