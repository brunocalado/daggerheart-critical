## What is it?

**Make every Critical Hit feel legendary.**

This module adds visceral impact to your Daggerheart sessions in Foundry VTT. When a player or GM rolls a critical success, the screen reacts with immersive visual effects and sound, amplifying the tension and excitement of the moment.

## Why use this?

In a narrative game like Daggerheart, a Critical Success is a major story beat. It shouldn't just be a text notification in the chat. This module ensures that everyone at the table *feels* the impact when the dice roll high.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **💥 Dynamic Visual FX:** Choose from a suite of powerful, screen-spanning visual effects:
    * **Glass Shatter:** The screen cracks and shards fly—perfect for a devastating blow.
    * **Screen Shake:** A physical rumble that sells the weight and force of an action.
    * **Pulsate:** A rhythmic visual heartbeat for moments of intense magical or psychic power.
    * **Energy Border:** A glowing, colored border that pulses and constricts the screen.
    * **Fine-Tune Everything:** Control the intensity, duration, and color of each effect to perfectly match the action on screen.

* **🔊 Cinematic Audio:** Automatically trigger custom sound effects to give crits their own auditory signature.
    * **Asymmetric Sound Design:** Assign different sounds for Player and GM criticals. Celebrate player victories with a heroic fanfare while a GM's crit is met with a terrifying horror sting.
    * **Bring Your Own Sounds:** Comes with ready-to-use SFX, or easily upload your own `.mp3` or `.ogg` files.

* **⚔️ Duality vs. Adversary:**
    * **For Players (Duality Dice):** Triggers when the Hope & Fear dice match.
    * **For GMs (Adversary Rolls):** Triggers on a d20 critical.

* **✨ Customizable Critical:** Display a stylish "CRITICAL!".
    * **Personalize It:** Easily change the overlay text, font,animation or use a custom image to fit your game's unique aesthetic.
